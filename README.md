Why is Docker useful for microservices?
Docker packages each microservice with its own environment, ensuring it runs the same everywhere. This makes building, deploying, and updating services faster and more reliable—perfect for complex apps like e-commerce or banking.

Docker image vs. container:
An image is a static blueprint of your app, while a container is a running instance of that image. You can run many containers from one image to handle more traffic and scale your app.

How does Kubernetes help?
Kubernetes manages and automates running many Docker containers, handling scaling, load balancing, and recovery—making it easy to run large, complex applications smoothly.
